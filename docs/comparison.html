        <p>I decided to look at the poems from the Locke Anthology and compare them against the other writings in the book. 
            After looking at the poems in voyant the most common words are “God” which is used 25 times, “Sun” which is used 18 times, “Like” also used 18 times, “Song” which is used 17 times and “Night” which is used 14 times. 
            Most of these terms are used most frequently in the poem “The Creation” which described how God created the Sun and the Earth. In the other writings in the anthology the words “God”, “Sun”, “Like”, “Song” and “Night” are used 
            48, 39, 204, 20, and 46 times respectively. In the Writings in the Anthology “God” is used in the context of prayers and scriptures, and “Like” is used for similies like how it is used in the set of poems. In the anthology, 
            the most common words are “Negro”, “New”, “Folk”, “American”, and “york”, and they are used 1158, 647, 338, 330, and 324 times respectively. In the poems, “Negro” is used 3 times,  “New” is used 5 times, “Folk” is used 3 times, 
            “American” is not used, and “York” is used once.</p>

        <p>Link to Text: <a href="https://archive.org/details/newnegrointerpre00unse/mode/2up"> The new Negro: an interpretation</a></p>
        
        <p>I decided to look at the poems from "The new Negro: an interpritation" edited by Alain Locke and compare them against the other writings in the book. "The new Negro" is an anthology of fiction, peotry, and essays that was realeased
            during the Harlem Renaissance and the anthology was about the African American culture at the time.</p>
            
           <p> After looking at the poems in voyant the most common words are “God” which is used 25 times, “Sun” which is used 18 times, “Like” also used 18 times, “Song” which is used 17 times and “Night” which is used 14 times. 
            Most of these terms are used most frequently in the poem “The Creation” which described how God created the Sun and the Earth. In the other writings in the anthology the words “God”, “Sun”, “Like”, “Song” and “Night” are used 
            48, 39, 204, 20, and 46 times respectively. In the Writings in the Anthology “God” is used in the context of prayers and scriptures, and “Like” is used for similies like how it is used in the set of poems. In the anthology, 
            the most common words are “Negro”, “New”, “Folk”, “American”, and “york”, and they are used 1158, 647, 338, 330, and 324 times respectively. In the poems, “Negro” is used 3 times,  “New” is used 5 times, “Folk” is used 3 times, 
            “American” is not used, and “York” is used once.</p>

        <p>In the Poems "And The" is typicaly used to signifiy that something is happening, for example "And the light broke" or "And the Lightnings flashed".
            The phrase "And The" is typically used before or after the other mentions an pbject or entitiy. In the Anthology when "And The" is used it is typically 
            used when a person is mentioned and it sets up what they are doing or what is being done to them. For example, "and the Negro Woman is sought after for this unpopular" or 
            "and the Negro is denied civil and political rights."</p>

        <p>In the Poems "In The" is used to when describing the location of someone or something. For example, "I bathed in the Euphrates" or "They send me to eat in the kitchen". 
           In the Anthology the phrase "In The" is used commonly used in the same ways as in the poem as it is also used to describe the location of an object or person, 
           for example "We have witnessed in the United States" or "The two races cannot ride in the same car".</p>

        <p>In the Poems "Of The" is sometimes used to describe where something or someone is from, for example "Fruit of the flower" or "Dark Madonna of the grave she rests". 
            "Of The" is also used to describe what someone or somthing is doing, for example "the chorus of the cane" or "I heard the singing of the mississippi"
            In the Anthology "Of The" is most commonly used when reffering to the struggles and challenges of African Americans, for example 
            "we reach a distinct stage in the treatment of the Negro in fiction" or "These writers refused to see the tragedt of the Negro and capitalized his comedy." </p>
        
        <p> By looking at the way they use these words and phrases I noticed that both poems and the anthology both deal with the struggles and challanges 
            that African Americans face at the time. These both deal with the same topic but the Poems naturally describe these challenges through 
            similies and metaphors, the authors take about the struggle of Black people while not directly stating them. On the other hand the 
            anthology as a whole takes a more up-front approach and the authors more directly speaks about challenges and there experiecne 
            as a Black person. Another thing that i noticed while looking at these texts where the differences in writing styles between the Fiction writings, the essays
            the dramas, and the poems. Unsurpringly the poems used more metaphors, similes, and idioms, where as in the other writings they dont appear as frequently. 
            Another thing that i noticed was the way that some of the peoms were written is similar to the way that the song lyrics and hyms were written. 
            When I looked at the poems on there own you can see distinct writing styles in the different authors, some authors have unique word choices, distinct rhyme schemes, or 
            common themes between poems. One common theme throughout the poems and the anthology as a whole was spirituality and religion, these themes are more common in 
            the poems but they are still common in the rest of the anthology.</p>

        <p>When you are creating a website there are two main ways you can do it, website creation tools like WordPress, or creating your own with HTML and Github. 
        WordPress is better for someone who has no experience with coding. With WordPress you don't need to do any coding, it is all done through the dashboard. 
        From the dashboard, you can do things like add pages and add or edit the content on your website. For some, this might be easier than coding a webpage, but WordPress still has some challenges. 
        On WordPress, it can be difficult for some people to navigate the dashboard and get their webpage to look how they want. 
        WordPress can be limited with what it lets you do to your webpage, and you don't have as much control as you would if you coded the webpage. 
        This can be a downside, but if you want to quickly create a professional-looking webpage. When making a webpage with HTML a big hurdle is learning how to actually write the code.Â  
        WordPress has numerous Themes to choose from but once you pick a theme there is little you can do to affect the overall look of it depending on the theme you choose. 
        It can also be difficult to edit the contents of your webpage. There were times when making the webpage that WordPress would be difficult and clunky to work with and that made it difficult to edit my webpage. 
        On the other hand, it may be difficult for people to learn the vocabulary and syntax that you need to use with HTML. 
        The upside to this is that once you learn HTML you practically have complete creative control over what your website looks like. Another difficulty with using HTML is Github. 
        Some people may have issues with pushing their websites to git hub, but in my experience, I had no issues with this. It is not only important to learn HTML but to also learn how to write a style sheet or CSS. 
        The style sheet allows affecting how your whole website looks from one sheet. In my experience, I had some difficulty getting the website to look exactly how I wanted it to look. 
        If there was one area I want to improve in it is the CSS, I had ideas for how I wanted my website to look that I wasn't able to do. 
        This again is an upside with WordPress because there are a lot of different themes and you are bound to find one that you like. 
        Personally, if I had to choose between using wordpress or HTML, I would pick HTML. It can be difficult at times to use but I think it is an overall better experience and I like the control it gives you as opposed to WordPress.</p>

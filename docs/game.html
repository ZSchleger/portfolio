        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p> I decided to look at the game "Carbon Steel" by Mike Klubnika. The game is set in a direlect lab and you are tasked with performing immoral experiments on organisms from the depths below.</p>

            <img src="pics/cs_lab.PNG" alt="The Lab" />
        <figcaption>The lab</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>The game starts with your character boarding an old shuttle that takes you to the lab,
        after entering the lab you are greeted by an email on an Apple Lisa 2 computer in the front of the room. The email informs you about the experiments you will be performing over the next three days. After reading the email your bedroom door opens, while you are sleeping 
        you see the last glimps of the surface that you might ever see. When you awake there is another email on the computer that explains how to use some of the machinery around the lab. You can then go to the back of the lab and pull the lever to raise a large steel cage from the depths below, 
        inside the cage you can hear the screams of the unkown organism within. When the cage is lifted up into the lab information about the organism is displayed on a monitor in the front and back of the lab. Using the information on the monitor and infromation on floppy disks you must formulate 
        an anaesthisa for the organism. After the Anaesthisa is injected into the cage, you are able to extract the organism in to a canister. Right as you extract the organism a slot on a mysterous door opens and you are able to deliver the organism to your employer and you can go to sleep. 
        When you get up you see a broken cage in the middle of the lab you see a grotesque monster staring at you with its numerous eyers and you can hear it's shrieks and screams. You soon awake from the nightmare and you are again greeted with an email on the computer telling you about a new machine
        that was fixed by an engineer. On the second day you repeat the same process as you did on the previous day but this time there is a new machine used to Identify the organism. Once you go to use the new machine a floopy disk pops out, the floopy disk contains a message from the engineer
        that repaired the machine. The engineer tells you not to trust the scientist and on the third day you must put the organism into a conister marked with an X. After this you continue to perfrom the same process from the previous day and deliver the organism. On the third day an email tells you that
        todays organism is from a far lower depth and will be extremely violent. Throughout the day the organism will try to break out of the cage and you must repair it with the frabrication gun. You then identify the organism and create the anaesthisa, but when you select the organism canister you are given a choice
        to listen to the Engineer and use the x canister or ignore him and use a regular canister. Depending on you choice it will vastly change the ending.</P>
        
        <h3>Good Ending</h3>
        <p>If you extract the organism into the canister marked with an X and deliver it to the scientists, you will hear an explosion and the screen goes black. When you regain consiousness you see that the lab was destroyed and you are able to leave the lab in the shuttle driven by the engineer.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <h3>Bad Ending</h3>
        <p>If you extract the organism into a regular canister adn deliver it to the scientist, you will be able to return to your room and go to sleed. When you wake up there is a finale email congradulating you on your good work, but the scientist want to try their experiments on 
        a smarter organism. While you are steel reading the email you can hear footsteps behind you and someone puts a bag over you head. When you regain conciousness you see that you are traped into the same cage that the organisms where in, and you here anaesthisa get injected into the cage.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p> The Character you play as has no name and is refered to by anon short for anonymous and they never speak. The character is working at the lab as a way to make some quick money.</p>
        <p> The main people you interact with are the scientists that run the lab. At the start of each day they send you an email that describes what you will be doing that day and the new machines they added.</p>
        <p> Another character you interact with is the Engineer. The Engineer is the one who is repairing and adding new machines to the lab, and they hid a message for you into one of the machines. The Engineer tells you that you are in danger and the scientist are going to do something to you. 
        The Engineer helps you escape by marking a Cansiter with an X that causes an explosion in the lab and you leave the lab with the Engineer on the shuttle.</p>
        
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>Overall i enjoyed this Carbon Steel, one of my favorite things about the game is the atmosphere. The game reminds me of a horror game from the early 2000s which I enjoy, and the music of the game reminds me of music by John Carpenter which adds to the atmosphere. I also enjoyed the gameplay, the game starts out simple and each day 
        another mechanic is added. The game complexity of the game increases and the last day was the most fun because of all the machines you need to interact with while also having to worry about the damage done to the cage. I enjoyed the game but there was some challanges at first. When i first plated the game i didnt know what i was supposed
        to do and i didnt know how the machines worked. There was alot of trial and error involved with trying to figure out what each machine does, but after i figured out what i was doing the game became alot more fun. My main complaint with the game is i wich it was longer. The most fun i had with the game was on the third day and i wich there
        was more of it, because it feels like the game ends right as it is getting fun. </p>

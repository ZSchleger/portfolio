            <!-- ebb: You can make a <section> or a <div> element just to organize different parts of the page.
      The <section> element should always have a heading element inside <h1>, <h2>, etc. to identify what's here.
     
     Using section elements and numbering your heading elements in order helps make your site maximally accessible to people who 
      read websites with screen readers, braille browsers, and other devices that don't rely exclusively on using your eyes.

            <h2>Lists: <dfn>ordered</dfn> and <dfn>unordered</dfn> </h2>
            <p>The heading above is smaller than the first one on this page, because I selected an <code>h2</code> element for a second-level heading.</p>
            <!-- ebb: Look up what a <dfn> element is for: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dfn.asp -->
            <!--ebb: You can write CSS code to change the *way* this is ordered, from numbers to letters or symbols, for example. -->
            <ol>
                <li>dawn</li>
                <li>afternoon</li>

            <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
            <p>HTML code has <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order
                as you create subsections! You can control the size, position, color, font, and more
                of headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
            <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are
                    <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
            <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level
                elements, or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make blocks on the page and
                are known as <dfn>block</dfn> elements.</p>
